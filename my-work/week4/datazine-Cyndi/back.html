        <p>In this project, I collected the numbers of different types of emotional words and emojis
          I used on WeChat with my friends on a daily basis, and created this datazine which is formed
          by the data collected from Sep 10th, 2019 to Oct 3rd, 2019.</p>
        <p>I use 5 colors to represent different types of emotional words and emojis.
          <span style = "color:red;opacity:0.5;font-weight:bold">Color pink</span> stands for the word "Ha" showing I'm extremely happy.
          <span style="color:orange;opacity:0.5;font-weight:bold">Color orange</span> represents the word "Wu" showing that I'm extremely sad.
          <span style="color:blue;opacity:0.5;font-weight:bold">Color blue</span> is for emojis expressing positive feelings,
          and <span style="color:green;opacity:0.5;font-weight:bold">color green</span> is for emojis expressing negative feelings.
          <span style="color:purple;opacity:0.5;font-weight:bold">Color purple</span> stands for the questionmarks I used when feeling confused.</p>
        <p>The cover is a mix of all the emotional words/emojis I used from Sep 10th to Oct 3rd.
          The numbers of the circles are the total number for each type of emotional words/emojis
          and are placed randomly. This is to illustrate the complexity of different feelings I underwent during the past 24 days.</p>
        <p>The middlespread is a heatmap matching the numbers of the words or emojis I used to the opacity
          of the rectangle. The more words/emojis I use, the darker the color is. For instance, I was extremely confused about the Capstone
          paper on Sep 11th, so the purple is darker than the other days indicating I used a lot of "?" on social media that day. I was very stressful
          about grad-school stuff on Sep 13th, so the orange is very dark showing me using a lot of "Wu"s.</p>
        <p>For the back page, I created a donut chart based on the percentage of each type of words/emojis. We can see
          that the word "Ha" make up a large proportion of all the emotional words/emojis, and the other four types are
          nearly evenly distributed.</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
