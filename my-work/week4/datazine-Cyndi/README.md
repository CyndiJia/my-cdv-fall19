# Introduction
In this project, I collected the numbers of different types of emotional words and emojis
I used on WeChat with my friends on a daily basis, and created this datazine which is formed
by the [data](https://github.com/CyndiJia/my-cdv-fall19/blob/master/my-work/week4/datazine-Cyndi/data.json) collected from Sep 10th, 2019 to Oct 3rd, 2019.

I use 5 colors to represent different types of emotional words and emojis. Color pink stands for the word "Ha" showing I'm extremely happy.
Color orange represents the word "Wu" showing that I'm extremely sad. Color blue is for emojis expressing positive feelings, and color green is for emojis expressing negative feelings. Color purple stands for the questionmarks I used when feeling confused.

### Cover
The cover is a **mix** of all the emotional words/emojis I used from Sep 10th to Oct 3rd. The numbers of the circles are the **total number** for each type of emotional words/emojis and are placed randomly. This is to illustrate the complexity of different feelings I underwent during the past 24 days.

### Middlespread
The middlespread is a **heatmap** matching the numbers of the words or emojis I used to the **opacity** of the rectangle. The more words/emojis I use, the darker the color is. For instance, I was extremely confused about the Capstone paper on Sep 11th, so the purple is darker than the other days indicating I used a lot of "?" on social media that day. I was very stressful about grad-school stuff on Sep 13th, so the orange is very dark showing me using a lot of "Wu"s.

### Back
For the back page, I created a **donut chart** based on the percentage of each type of words/emojis. We can see that the word "Ha" make up a large proportion of all the emotional words/emojis, and the other four types are nearly evenly distributed.

#### Reflection
The process of creating this chart is relatively harder than past assignments because the donut chart and the position of percentage are totally new to me. However, I was also thrilled to explore more about d3, for instance, path, pie chart, centroid, etc. The heatmap is also a bit tricky when it comes to the scaleband function which also took me a while to understand, but it is also super convenient. Thanks to d3 for generating math formulas automatically so that I don't have to do the complicated calculations by myself.

Enjoy!
