Yes, started from the time when people begin to share their information online, the companies were able to get more data from their users, including the users' name, age, hometown, past schools/work experiences, etc. By getting this kind of personal information of users, the companies know their users better by analyzing everything provided in the data, at the same time making predictions of the users' potential action in the future. For instance, after you search for a dress on Taobao, the recommendation section will be full of similar dresses or clothes of that specific brand. Taobao looks at your preference for commodities and intentionally recommend you the products that you have higher chances to buy, which provide you with more choices.

However, is this kind of data collection a good thing or a bad thing? If the companies only use the data for product improvements, it seems to be a good thing. But if our data were trade between different companies without notifying us, then our privacy is violated. Data is no longer purely used for improving the services, but more for increasing the profits of companies by using our data to predict the future.

> "It sustains and nourishes uneven power relationships: in most of our interactions with power, data is not something that is freely given but forcibly extracted..."
