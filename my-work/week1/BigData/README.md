# Critical Questions for Big Data
**Here is my response**:

*1*. a

*2*. b

*3*. Limitations of Twitter are quiet obvious. Firstly, the users registered in Twitter does not represent all people, since there are still many people who don't use twitter at all, or just look at twitter on their browser without registering for an account. The accounts on Twitter are also not a good source for data collection, because a person can own several different accounts at the same time, and there are many robots on twitter that don't reflect anything of the user. Also, it's hard to exclude human factors when collecting the data, such as internet police who remove many posts/pictures that have negative impact on the society, so the data collected cannot fully represent users' preferences and reactions. Furthermore, the data are not objective at all, since the browsing habit of each user is very different too. For instance, Some user like to retweet, while others tend to click likes. Some users click likes because they like the content, while others just want to keep an record of the content, or they don't like the content but want the content to be notorious. It is hard to know what the user is thinking about from data collection when they are interacting with something published on line. Personal relationships between one and another also cannot be determined simply from their interactions online. The data of one person can be inaccurate, and if we put the data of many people together, there can be a huge bias. What we get from data can only represent a small part of what we are trying to study from the data.

*4*. If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, it doesn't mean that the data is public and free to use, because you can't control how you will be using the data. When you see something online without logging in, it simply means that you are able to see it, however, without the author's permission on how to use the data, it is very rude to use it for other purposes. What we see on the internet might not be what we see. If any misinterpretation happens during the process, not only the result of the usage will be inaccurate, but also the privacy and reputation of the author will be seriously harmed.
