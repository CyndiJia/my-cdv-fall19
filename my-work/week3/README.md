***

### Situation 1 : Weather Forecast Application
When people are using the weather forecast application, they are able to know the weather of upcoming days to determine what to wear and whether to bring an umbrella or not. Weather forecast are made by collecting as much data as possible of the current state of the atmosphere, including the temperature, chance of rain, wind, humidity, etc. Then these data are used by experts in this area to predict how the weather changes in the future.

### Situation 2 : Online Shopping Application
When browsing online shopping websites like TaoBao, after I search for something that I might buy in the future, TaoBao will find similar products and recommend them to me in the homepage. TaoBao accesses the data of what I've searched and the number of the times I searched for the product to get to know more about my shopping habits, then push notifications of similar products and try to get me to buy more, and I have to say I was always attracted by TaoBao's recommendations of products, and eventually, spent more and more money during online shopping.

### Situation 3 : DIDI(an application for calling a taxi online)
After using DIDI for several times, the user's information is more and more complete in DIDI's user profile system. By collecting and analyze the data of the user's locations, destinations and spendings on the trip, DIDI get to know where the user usually stay at, also what type of car the user tend to call and how much the user can afford for a taxi ride. Thus, the next time the user open DIDI, there will be an auto-selection for the user's location/destination, and also showing the price of the trip determined by the user's consumption level. Since DIDI is able to capture the user's habits of calling a car, the user will keep using this app.
