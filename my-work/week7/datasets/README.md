## 3 Datasets that I found interesting
#### [Cocktails (Hotaling & Co.)](https://www.kaggle.com/lishuyangkaggle/cocktails-hotaling-co/downloads/cocktails-hotaling-co.zip/2)
This dataset is a well-rounded information about various kinds of cocktails in different areas of the United States. It includes the information of company name, bartender,  locations, ingredients, garnishes, glasswares and preparations. I can imagine the data story project used by this dataset turned out to be a data animation of the making process of those cocktails, from choosing ingredients, setting the proportion, choosing garnishes and glasswares  to making it out.

#### [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
This dataset collects the information of airbnbs all over New York City, including the location, reviews, latitude, neighborhood, roomtype, etc. The dataset is extremely useful for people who are going to book an airbnb in NYU as it provides all the information one might need. To build a project around this dataset,  I might choose the category with pure numbers in this dataset and generate the relationship between different number factors.

#### [Goodreads-books](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)
This dataset not only documents the average rating of the books but also provides solid integers and floats categorizing the numbers of reviews, total number of ratings, number of pages, etc. This dataset is very clean and credible because of its clear and straightforward data. This could turn into a interactive book review system by presenting and making comparisons between the data of different books.
