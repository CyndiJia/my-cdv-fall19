        <p id="de">This project explores the stories of four popular Chinese songs after they were released,
          which are <span style="font-weight:bold">"The Story of Us" by JJ Lin</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">"Won't Cry" by Jay Chou</span>,
          <span style="font-weight:bold">"Dawn" by Kris Wu</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold" >"The Rivals" by Evan Lin</span>.
          I collected the data and studied the performance of these four songs on two Chinese mainstream music/online discussion
          platforms, <span style="color: #69b3a2">"QQ Music"</span> and <span style="color:#b3697a">"Douban"</span>.</p>

          <p id="qmu"><span style="color: #69b3a2">QQ Music</span> is one of the biggest online music platforms in China.
          With the prevalence of digital music and rising awareness of music copyright, many songs in
         current music market are not for free - users need to buy the songs on QQ music
         to listen to them. QQ music have different <span style="color: #69b3a2">awards</span> for a song
         according to the <span style="color: #69b3a2">salesamount</span>.
         In this project, I collected the <span style="color: #69b3a2">progress achievements</span> of the four songs and analyzed the data
         according to the timelines.</p>

            songs. Users are able to rate the music (from 1 point to 5 point), and write comments under certain music source.
